# Newman_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final project

For this project I created a board game. This game includes 3 main features, a rolling system to move a payer foward, a card system where players collect and can use cards in order to improve thier chance of winning, and a fight system where occasionally two players standing on 1 spot will have to fight to find out who gets to stay.

You must have a cards.txt file included in order to play the game. This file includes any amount of cards of 5 different types to be included. Each card in the file must have a description, a type value, and a modifyer. The 5 types are, in order, move yourself foward, move an opponent backwards, roll multiple times, make an opponent move slower for a turn, or skip the next player.

To start the game first choose the amount of human and computer players(up to 5 total). Then you can choose the length of the board next. After this the game will start with the first player added. The player cn either roll, view and use cards, quit the game, or re-view the board. After rolling the game will move onto the next player.

In the case of a player landing on a spot with another player, a 'fight' might break out. This fight will be a rock paper scissors match, where the loser must move back 5 positions.

The game ends either after a player quiing or a player winning.
